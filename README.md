# LCM_Algorithim
Using different algorithms to find numbers that have consecutive integer factors.

Read the fact that 2520 is the Lowest Common Multiple (LCM) of the consecutive integers 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 and 10.
So it got me thinking, what are the other numbers with LCM of consecutive integers?

And so this repository was born to invstiagte this.

Why do this instead of just googling it?
It is challenging and fun!

This then lead me onto discussing how to find these numbers and it was only natural to progress to:

What is the fastest way to find these numbers? 

Hence the different algorithms!

Enjoy!


Until commit a37ffc08f26a8de64ec5494fc2cf7c42d113046e I have been looking at the problem the wrong way.
I have been picking a number and checking if it has consecutive factors.

Instead i should be picking integer numbers and finding the LCM!
